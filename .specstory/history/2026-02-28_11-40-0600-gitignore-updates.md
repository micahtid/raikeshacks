# .gitignore updates (2026-02-28 11:40-0600)

_**User**_

Add specstory, .history, and .cursorindexingignore to .gitignore

_**Agent (model default, mode Agent)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>

The user wants to add three entries to the .gitignore file:
1. specstory
2. .history
3. .cursorindexingignore

Let me first read the current .gitignore file to see its contents and then add these entries.

I see the .gitignore file. I'll add the three new entries. I'll add them in a logical place - perhaps a new section for Cursor/editor-related items since .history and .cursorindexingignore are Cursor-related, and specstory might be a tool or folder. I'll add them at the end with a brief comment.

Done. I added specstory, .history, and .cursorindexingignore to .gitignore under a new "Cursor / tooling" section. The user's request is complete.

Updated `.gitignore` with `specstory`, `.history`, and `.cursorindexingignore` under a new "Cursor / tooling" section at the end of the file.

_**User**_

Create a new branch called feature/student-profile-crud-api, along with a commit message: Add student profile CRUD API with MongoDB schema validation, and push staged changes to the new branch.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>

The user wants me to:
1. Create a new branch called feature/student-profile-crud-api
2. Add a commit with the message "Add student profile CRUD API with MongoDB schema validation"
3. Push staged changes to the new branch

I need to run git commands. Let me do this in sequence:
1. First, I should check the current git status to see what's staged
2. Create the new branch (this will include uncommitted changes if we're on another branch)
3. Stage any changes if needed (user said "push staged changes" - so they may have already staged. Let me check)
4. Commit with the message
5. Push to the new branch

Actually, re-reading the request: "push staged changes to the new branch" - they want to:
1. Create new branch
2. Commit with that message (so the staged changes get committed)
3. Push the new branch

So the flow would be:
1. Create branch: git checkout -b feature/student-profile-crud-api
2. If there are unstaged changes they want included, we might need to stage. But they said "staged changes" so maybe things are already staged. Let me just create branch, then add all if needed, commit, push.
3. git add -A (or maybe they're already staged - I'll check status first)
4. git commit -m "Add student profile CRUD API with MongoDB schema validation"
5. git push -u origin feature/student-profile-crud-api

Let me run the commands. I'll need git_write and network permissions for creating branch, committing, and pushing.

PowerShell doesn't use && for chaining. I need to use ; or separate commands. Let me try with semicolon.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>

Nothing is staged yet. The user said "push staged changes" - I'll stage the relevant files (the student profile CRUD API stuff). I should probably not include .specstory/history as that's specstory-related and we added specstory to gitignore. So I'll:
1. Create the new branch
2. Stage the web_server changes (app.py, db.py, models/, requirements.txt) - not the .specstory stuff since that's in gitignore
3. Commit with the message
4. Push

Let me create the branch, stage the web_server files and app.py, commit, and push.
